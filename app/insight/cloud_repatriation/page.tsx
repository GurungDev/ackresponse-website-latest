                    <div className="my-10 space-y-4">
                        <p className="md:text-lg text-start font-light  tracking-wide">
                        The transition from legacy systems to cloud-based infrastructure has been driven by the need for businesses to stay competitive in an increasingly digital world. Legacy systems, often characterized by outdated hardware, inflexible software, and limited scalability, have become a bottleneck for innovation. As businesses began to deploy containerized applications, the need for a more agile and scalable infrastructure became evident. Public cloud platforms provided the perfect solution, offering on-demand resources, robust security features, and service level agreements (SLAs) that guaranteed high uptime and reliability.
                        </p>
                        <p className="md:text-lg text-start font-light  tracking-wide">
                         In particular, the ability to scale applications seamlessly in the cloud has been a game-changer for many enterprises. The elasticity of cloud services allows businesses to adjust their resource allocation based on demand, avoiding the need for significant upfront investments in physical infrastructure. This scalability is complemented by the inherent security features of public cloud platforms, where data protection and compliance are handled by cloud providers with industry-leading expertise.
                        </p>
                        <p className="md:text-lg text-start font-light  tracking-wide">
                         Additionally, the shift to cloud infrastructure has resulted in cost savings, particularly in terms of capital expenditure (CAPEX). Businesses no longer need to invest heavily in physical data centers, instead leveraging the infrastructure provided by cloud service providers. This model has allowed enterprises to convert their IT expenses from CAPEX to OPEX, paying for only the resources they consume.

                    <div className="my-10 space-y-4">
                         <p className="md:text-lg text-start font-light  tracking-wide">
                        However, the allure of public cloud services has not come without its challenges. While the transition to the cloud promised cost savings, many enterprises have encountered unexpected long-term OPEX expenses that have exceeded initial forecasts. As workloads grow and data volumes increase, the cost of running applications on public cloud platforms can spiral, leading to significantly higher monthly bills. This is particularly true for enterprises with complex and resource-intensive applications, where the cumulative cost of compute, storage, and network services can become a substantial financial burden.
                        </p>
                         <p className="md:text-lg text-start font-light  tracking-wide">
                         Beyond the financial implications, enterprises are also grappling with the increasing sensitivity of their data. As businesses accumulate more data, they become more cautious about how and where that data is processed. The hesitation to utilize hyperscalers’ AI and ML services stems from concerns over data privacy, security, and the potential misuse of sensitive information. Enterprises are wary of exposing their most valuable data to third-party platforms, especially when it comes to training AI models, generating predictions, and deriving insights. The risk of data breaches or the unintended disclosure of proprietary information has led many organizations to rethink their reliance on public cloud services for these critical tasks.

                        Adding to the complexity of the situation is the advent of new-generation technologies such as 5G Network Slicing, Transport Layer Slicing, and Open-RAN (Radio Access Network) Slicing. These technologies represent the cutting edge of telecom and networking innovation, promising unprecedented levels of flexibility, efficiency, and customization in network management. However, hyperscalers have been slow to develop the orchestration and management capabilities required to support these advanced technologies on their platforms.
                        </p>
                         <p className="md:text-lg text-start font-light  tracking-wide">
                        For verticals like telecommunications, the ability to orchestrate and manage network slices effectively is crucial. Network slicing allows telecom operators to create multiple virtual networks on a single physical infrastructure, each optimized for different types of services or customers. The lack of robust orchestration features in hyperscaler platforms means that telcos are often forced to develop their own proprietary systems to manage these network slices, which align more effectively with private cloud environments. This has led to a growing reluctance among telcos to deploy their workloads on public cloud platforms, where they may not have the control or capabilities needed to fully leverage these cutting-edge technologies.
